This repository consits of 3 branches to demonstrate different ways of using Next.js with a headless wagtail site, as well as features such as previewing draft pages and on demand re-validation.

- SSR-nested-dynamic-routing-with-wagtail-grapple
- SSG-nested-dynamic-routing-with-wagtail-grapple
- SSG-nested-dynamic-routing-with-wagtail-grapple-and-on-demand-revalidation

If you'd like to run this site locally please set up and run the headless Wagtail CMS first -> https://github.com/Morsey187/bakerydemo.

For more info I've written an article -> https://benmor.se/articles/nested-dynamic-routing-with-nextjs-and-wagtail/.
